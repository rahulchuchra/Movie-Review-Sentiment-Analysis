      "After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.  The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.  The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.  Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than \"genial best friend of the main character.\" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.  The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights. Recommended.\n"
